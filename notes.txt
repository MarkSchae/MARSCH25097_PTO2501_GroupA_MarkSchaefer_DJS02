One class to handle each concept

A class to handle the data (loading and saving)

A class to handle the creation of the task array object and to handle modyfying the task array object 

A class to handle rendering the task array object 

Combine the arrays of static data making it easier to display the data 

Save the new combined array into local storage so that the new array can be saved after any changes

Need to find a way to be able to write autocomplete tailwind in a js file for adding classlist properties

Think about a helper function for creating DOM elements

Might need to seperate some logic and dom creation in the render class

Remember to use functional programming for pure data (no modyfying arrays etc)
